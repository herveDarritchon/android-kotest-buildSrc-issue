# android-kotest-buildSrc-issue
A simple project to explain the issue I have with test in buildSrc

In my module `businessLogicBuildSrc`I can import test dependencies like junit5 or kotest and run test.
In my buildSrc, I can't import test dependencies, neither jUnit5 or kotest and obviously I can't run tests :(
